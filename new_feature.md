The new feature I attempted to add was the entire periodic table. The periodic table should be organized like the periodic table and clicking on an element should highlight its group. It is reasonable to expect because the periodic table is a well known table that should be able to be replicated. The code was supposed to show all 118 items in the periodic table and have those elements grouped correctly. I attempted to have ChatGPT create the array that held the periodic table elements in the entire JS file but it only generated about 30 elements. I attempted to have ChatGPT generate just the array but it still failed to generate all the elements. Finally I prompted ChatGPT to create the array in chunks. This was more successful, I got all 118 elements, but the grouping of the elements was incorrect.
